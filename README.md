Uber Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber rides dataset to uncover demand trends, peak hours, ride purposes, and geographical hotspots.
This project demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization skills using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze Uber trip data to extract meaningful insights that can improve demand forecasting, driver allocation, and route optimization.
Key steps included:
1.Data preprocessing (handling missing values, parsing datetime columns).
2.Feature engineering (hour of day, weekday, month, ride categories).
3.Temporal and categorical trend analysis.
4.Visualizations to identify demand patterns and hotspots.

🔍 Key Insights
📈 Ride demand peaks during morning (7–9 AM) and evening (5–7 PM) hours.
🗓️ Weekdays show higher ride frequencies compared to weekends.
💼Business rides dominate the dataset, while personal rides increase during weekends.
📊 Seasonal variations suggest certain months have higher demand.
